// Q4.7 Write a program that takes a block of text and formats it into two columns, so that the text can
// be printed on the screen in the two columns. Each column should be forty characters wide and text
// should be adjusted so that only complete words show on each line. Make use of pointers, strings
// (character arrays), with all memory allocated dynamically on the heap.
// Additional challenges:
// i) Read the original text from a file.
// ii) Write the formatted text out to a file.
// iii) Allow the number and width of columns to be specified.
// iv) Add support for hyphenation, allowing words to be split across two lines.
